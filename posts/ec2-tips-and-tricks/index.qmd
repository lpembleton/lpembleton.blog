The following is written with the default assumption of a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base image

## Installing AWS CLI

AWS CLI is a must to enable you to transfer files and results between S3 and your EC2 instance

First you will need to install `unzip`

``` bash
sudo apt-get install unzip
```

Now you can download and install the AWS CLI

``` bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

This should automatically appear in your path and you can call it with `aws`

You will need to configure it with your credentials so that it will have the appropriate permissions ðŸ”‘ to connect to S3

`aws configure`

Alternatively, a more secure option is to pass the relevant S3 permissions to your EC2 instance using an IAM instance profile. Details on setting up a IAM role with S3 permissions can be found [here](https://cloud-gc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter03_advanced-tutorial/iam-role.html).

You can add the IAM profile when first creating your instance under 'Advanced details'

![](images/iam-instance-profile.png)

or to an existing instance by selecting the instance, clicking 'Actions' drop-down menu and then 'Modify IAM role' under 'Security' and then choosing the relevant IAM role. Then press 'Update IAM role'.

## Mount a secondary volume such as a Nitro NVME SSD

If you launch a storage-optimised EC2 instance such as one from the [I4i family](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/i4i/) to take advantage of the super-fast local storage performance you might get a rude shock at first, where is the SSD ðŸ˜•? All you initially have access to is the EBS boot volume\... Nothing to fear, it is there, it just hasn't been mounted yet.

use the `lsblk` command to view your available disk devices and their mount points.

``` bash
NAME         MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
loop0          7:0    0  24.4M  1 loop /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/6312
loop1          7:1    0  55.6M  1 loop /snap/core18/2745
loop2          7:2    0  63.3M  1 loop /snap/core20/1879
loop3          7:3    0 111.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24322
loop4          7:4    0  53.2M  1 loop /snap/snapd/19122
nvme1n1      259:0    0   1.7T  0 disk 
nvme0n1      259:1    0     8G  0 disk 
â”œâ”€nvme0n1p1  259:2    0   7.9G  0 part /
â”œâ”€nvme0n1p14 259:3    0     4M  0 part 
â””â”€nvme0n1p15 259:4    0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
```

Identify the name of missing drive you want to mount, for example `nvme1n1`

Now check whether there is a file system already on the device

``` bash
sudo file -s /dev/<DRIVE-NAME>
```

If this just shows `data` as the screen output there is not file system currently on the device. However if it shows other information for example

``` bash
[ubuntu ~]$ sudo file -s /dev/nvme1n1
/dev/nvme1n1: SGI XFS filesystem data (blksz 4096, inosz 512, v2 dirs)
```

It means there is already a file system.

Assuming there is no current files system (likely scenario for new instances) you need to make one with the `mkfs -t` command before you can mount it.

``` bash
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/<DRIVE-NAME>
```

::: callout-tip
If you get a `mkfs.xfs` is not found error. You just need to install the XFS tools first using:

`sudo apt-get install xfsprog`
:::

Once the filesystem is established, all you need to do is mount it and point it at a directory.

You can point it at any directory but in this example we are going to create a directory call `data`

``` bash
mkdir data
sudo mount /dev/<DRIVE-NAME> /home/ubuntu/data
```

To check this has all worked correctly if you run `lsblk` again you should see your drive of interest show up with the associated mountpoint directory.

``` bash
NAME         MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
loop0          7:0    0  24.4M  1 loop /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/6312
loop1          7:1    0  55.6M  1 loop /snap/core18/2745
loop2          7:2    0  63.3M  1 loop /snap/core20/1879
loop3          7:3    0 111.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24322
loop4          7:4    0  53.2M  1 loop /snap/snapd/19122
nvme1n1      259:0    0   1.7T  0 disk /home/ubuntu/data
nvme0n1      259:1    0     8G  0 disk 
â”œâ”€nvme0n1p1  259:2    0   7.9G  0 part /
â”œâ”€nvme0n1p14 259:3    0     4M  0 part 
â””â”€nvme0n1p15 259:4    0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
```

It is likely you will need to update the ownership permission of the mounted directory as it would have been mount as `root`

To change the permissions to reflect your current user

``` bash
sudo chown -R $USER /home/ubuntu/data
```

::: callout-caution
nvme drives on EC2 instances are typically ephemeral disks, meaning they physically exist on the actual host instance and therefore they do not persist after reboots or shutdown (as the new physical host will change). All data will be lost and you will need to remount after a restart.

## Installing the latest stable R on Ubuntu

#### Step 1: Obtain the R Project GPG Key

To start, you need to acquire the R Project's public GPG key. This key will ensure the authenticity and security of the software you're about to install. Open your terminal and use the following command:

``` bash
wget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/r-project.gpg 
```

#### Step 2: Add the R Source List to APT

With the GPG key in place, it's time to add the R source list to APT. This list is essential for Ubuntu to recognise the repository where R is located. Run the following command:

``` bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/r-project.gpg] https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu jammy-cran40/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/r-project.list 
```

#### Step 3: Update Your Package List

To make Ubuntu aware of the new source you've added, update your package list with the following command:

``` bash
sudo apt update 
```

#### Step 4: Install R with APT

Now, you're ready to install R on your system. Execute this command:

``` bash
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends r-base 
```

::: callout-tip
If prompted to confirm the installation, simply press 'y' and then 'Enter' to proceed.
:::

That's it! You've successfully installed the latest stable version of R on your Ubuntu machine.

## Install relevant R packages

Installing packages in R on Windows is a relatively straightforward process, typically accomplished using the \`instally.packages()\` function. However, the process can be a bit more involved on Linux, as you'll often need to manually install external dependencies. In this article, we'll provide you with essential details for common packages, making the installation process smoother.

In many cases, you'll find that the 'make' command is a fundamental requirement. While you can install 'make' as a standalone package, it's usually more beneficial to install a comprehensive set of build tools through the 'build-essential' package.

To install 'build-essential' on a Debian-based Linux system like Ubuntu, run the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

#### Tidyverse

the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a large collection of packages and therefore naturally there are a reasonable list of dependencies. The following should install all the required libraries.

``` bash
sudo apt install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev unixodbc-dev libxml2-dev libmariadb-dev libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev
```

#### BLGR

The genomic selection package [BLGR](https://github.com/gdlc/BGLR-R) has a few additional dependencies.

``` bash
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran
```

## Installing bioinformatic software

#### PLINK2

Installing plink2 is as simple get grabbing the Linux-64bit Intel zipped binary from the [website](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/#new) and unpacking it. Then just move the executable to your bin dir.

For example:

``` bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/plink2-assets/alpha5/plink2_linux_x86_64_20231011.zip
unzip plink2_linux_x86_64_20231011.zip
sudo mv plink2 /bin/
```

#### VCFtools

Grab the tarball from the github [release page](https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools/releases) and unpack it.

``` bash
wget https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools/releases/download/v0.1.16/vcftools-0.1.16.tar.gz
tar -xvf vcftools-0.1.16.tar.gz
```

The PERL5LIB environment variable needs to be set to include the vcf.pm module.

``` bash
export PERL5LIB=/path/to/your/vcftools-directory/src/perl/
```

Before you can compile the program you need to install the following dependency

``` bash
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install pkg-config
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
```

You must now compile the program.

``` bash
cd vcftools-0.1.16/
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

VCFtools will be automatically added to your user path so you should now be able to call it with `vcftools`

#### BCFtools

A similar process to VCFtools, grab the BCFtools tarball from the latest [releases page](http://www.htslib.org/download/) and run `configure`, `make` and `install`.
