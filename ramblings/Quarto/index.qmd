## Folding Non-Executable Code in Quarto Documents

In [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), folding non-executable code blocks may seem challenging since the built-in [code-folding](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code) \`#\| code-fold: true\` for non-executed blocks is not supported. This can be particularly inconvenient when working with extensive external commands like bash scripts used for data preprocessing.

Fortunately, a simple solution is available, as [shared](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4693) in response to a Quarto GitHub issue. You can achieve code folding for non-executable code by wrapping it in HTML `<details>` tags. Here's an example:

````         
<details>
<summary>Code: My non-executable code</summary>

```bash
cat vcf_file | sed -n '/#CHROM/,$p' | cut -f 1,2,4,5 > variant_info.txt 
```

</details>
````

Which when rendered will look like ðŸ‘‡

<details>

<summary>Code: My non-executable code</summary>

``` bash
cat vcf_file | sed -n '/#CHROM/,$p' | cut -f 1,2,4,5 > variant_info.txt 
```

</details>

This method allows you to organize and present non-executable code blocks more effectively in your Quarto documents.
